### About structr-rest

The module structr-rest exposes the functionality of structr-core and Neo4j as a REST web service.

With structr-rest you can easily build your own JSON/REST service backend based on your specific domain objects (nodes/relationships/hyper-relationships).

- Mapping of REST resources to domain model
- Serialization/deserialization between entities and JSON objects using GSON
- Sorting
- Paging
- Result count
- Timing information (query_time, serialization_time)
- Modular authentication
- Authorization (allow/deny access to specific resources)
